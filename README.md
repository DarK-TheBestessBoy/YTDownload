# YTDownload
Its a custom python script using the library pytube. Be sure to install that with 'pip install pytube' before trying to use this.
to run, use 'python yt.py'. It should work both with python 2.x and 3.x

# How to use:
You may either give it a link by an argument (eg. 'python yt.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4') (note that it doesn't matter if you use the full link, youtu.be link or only the video ID), or you place the links (every one of them in a new line) in the list.txt (it should be created when you first run the script)
If you run it like 'python yt.py cow [optional link]', you will have a cow announce the status (you should have cowsay installed)
